# quotes-reader

A Java command line application that parses a JSON file with quotes to read a random quote.

# Usage
```shell
./gradlew run
```
This will get you a random quote  

```shell
./gradlw run --args author/tag/contains author name/tag/word  


```

This takes in two args, what way you want your quote to come in, and text that goes along with.  

# How it works

```shell 
./gradlew run
./gradlew run --args 'help'
./gradlew run --args 'author John Doe'
./gradlew run --args 'tag Cool'
./gradlew run --args contains Epic
./gradlew test
```
